"This project demonstrates web scraping and data extraction using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4. It includes:

project.py: A script that uses Selenium to navigate through pages on 'Books to Scrape' and saves the HTML of each product listing.
collect.py: A script that processes the saved HTML files with BeautifulSoup to extract book titles, prices, and links, and saves the data into a CSV file.
